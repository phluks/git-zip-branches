!!!WARNING!!!

This script has not quite had the final polishing.

Even when it has, it may mess up your repo. Make sure, that you are working
on a copy.
(cp -R <your-repo> <name-of-copy>).

It can't safely zip across merges.

DESCRIPTION
This script combines two branches into one with the commits date ordered.

You will have to clean up yourself afterwards.

I recommend gitg for visualizing states before and after.

Usage:
git-zip-branches.sh <branch1> <branch2>
